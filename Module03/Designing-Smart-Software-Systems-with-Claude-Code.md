# Claude Code: Software Engineering with Generative AI Agents  
## âœ… Module 03: Generative AI, Claude Code & Code Quality

### ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned:

1. **Why Code Evaluation Matters:**  
   - AI helps build multiple solutions fast, but we need to evaluate and pick the best one.
   - Systematic evaluation helps us decide architecture and code quality.

2. **Setting Up Systematic Evaluation:**  
   - Verified multiple code branches (feature-data-export-v1, v2, v3).
   - Used Claude to analyze technical architecture, code structure, libraries, error handling, and performance.

3. **Chat, Craft, and Scale System:**  
   - **Chat:** Explore ideas and plan designs.
   - **Craft:** Think through implementation details (libraries, folder structure, prompts).
   - **Scale:** Later focus on scaling the system.

4. **Rapid Prototyping & Personas:**  
   - Simulated the API design using persona patterns to test interfaces without coding yet.
   - Avoided building wrong solutions by role-playing the system.

5. **Craft Constraints & Prompts:**  
   - Thought about ergonomics â€“ what kind of code structure and interfaces are easiest for developers and AI.
   - Designed smart prompts for Claude Code to follow step-by-step, instead of giving it big unclear tasks.

### ðŸš€ My Key Takeaways:
- Always design first, build later.
- Break big problems into small testable steps.
- Simulate prototypes before coding.
- Design the right prompts to get the best results from Claude Code.

ðŸ“š Next steps: Apply these lessons to build real software apps confidently.
