# Module 06 â€“ Claude Code: Think First, Code Second

âœ¨ **Golden Takeaway from Module 06**  
Before asking Claude Code to *implement* features, first ask it to **think, analyze, and plan deeply**.  
This "think first, code second" approach avoids costly mistakes, makes architecture more robust, and creates a clear design trail.  

### Key Learnings:
- **Extended Thinking Modes**  
  - `think` â†’ quick reasoning for simple tasks  
  - `think hard` â†’ deeper analysis for medium complexity  
  - `think harder` â†’ comprehensive planning for complex features  
  - `ultrathink` â†’ maximum deep thinking for highly complex integrations  

- **Save the Plan**  
  - Always save Claudeâ€™s analysis as `FEATURE_PLAN.md` or `INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md` before coding.  
  - These files act as documentation, help in debugging, onboarding new team members, and future reference.  

- **Project Structure Matters**  
  - Clear folder and file names = rich context for Claude.  
  - Following standard naming conventions (e.g., `store/`, `reducers/`, `actions/`) gives Claude immediate understanding.  
  - A well-structured project makes Claude more efficient, reduces token usage, and ensures accurate changes.  

### Why It Matters  
ðŸš€ With AI coding assistants, the real power isnâ€™t just in generating code fastâ€”itâ€™s in **making them think, plan, and use context wisely**.  
Good structure + deep planning = fewer errors, faster progress, and scalable AI-powered development.
