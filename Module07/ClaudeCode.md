# Module 07: From Coffee-Stained Napkin to Production Code with Multimodal Prompting

**Completion Status:** âœ… Passed with 100% score  
**Certificate Earned:** Yes  

## Overview

Module 07 focuses on **practical software engineering with AI assistance** using Claude Code.  
The key idea: instead of manually editing AI-generated code every time, you **program the process and context** to make AI output **repeatable, scalable, and high-quality**.

### Key Concepts

1. **Claude.md File**
   - Central place to define rules, instructions, and context for AI coding.
   - Editing this file improves repeatability and reduces manual corrections.

2. **Command Files**
   - Define specific instructions for recurring tasks.
   - Ensures AI performs actions correctly every time.

3. **Visual Communication**
   - Using sketches, mockups, diagrams, or screenshots to communicate UI/UX and system design to AI.
   - Examples: Dashboard layouts, charts, user flows, animations, error states, database schema, architecture diagrams.

4. **Programming the Process**
   - Instead of fixing code manually every time, update the **Claude.md** or command files.
   - Goal: scalable, repeatable AI-assisted development.

## Practical Application

In my **MiniExpenseTracker** project, I applied Module 07 principles to:

- Implement the **Monthly Summary** feature.
- Create **run-summary.js script** for automated insights.
- Refine instructions to Claude Code for **repeatable, reliable outputs**.
- Use **visual sketches** for layout and chart design, speeding up development.

This approach **minimized manual editing** and improved workflow efficiency.

## Learning Takeaways

- AI can be treated as a **programmable collaborator**.
- Updating context and commands is **more scalable than fixing code manually**.
- Visual inputs for AI reduce ambiguity in **UI/UX, charts, dashboards, and system design**.
- Process-focused thinking is key to **AI-assisted software engineering**.

**Certificate & Credential:**  
Earned after completing Module 07 with full marks.  
Claude Code has now become a powerful tool for **scalable software development**.
